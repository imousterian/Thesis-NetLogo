This is my Master's thesis work done back in 2010, published in 2012,  and finally pushed to GitHub in 2014.
This is a simulation model representing the interaction between survivors of domestic violence and social services.
Details are available in Drigo-Sergeyeva, M., C. Ehlschlaeger, and E. L. Sweet (2012). Intimate Partner Violence and Support Systems, in Ecologist‐ Developed Spatially‐Explicit Dynamic Landscape Models, edited by James Westervelt and Gordon Cohen. Springer: New York.

The model is written in NetLogo, and agent-based programming language (http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/). 
In order to run the model, you must download and install NetLogo environment (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml)
Then click and open Chicago-IPV.nlogo. The model must use the accompanied data.
The data for the model come in two forms: geographic (GIS) data are located in 'gis_data' directory (containing Chicago boundary files and others), 
and data on households, population and location of social services are located in 'data' directory.
