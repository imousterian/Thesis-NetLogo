This is my Master's thesis work done back in 2010, published in 2012,  and finally made more public in 2014 through GitHub.
This is a simulation model representing the interaction between survivors of domestic violence and social services.
Details are available in Drigo-Sergeyeva, M., C. Ehlschlaeger, and E. L. Sweet (2012). Intimate Partner Violence and Support Systems, in Ecologist‐ Developed Spatially‐Explicit Dynamic Landscape Models, edited by James Westervelt and Gordon Cohen. Springer: New York.

The model is written in NetLogo, and agent-based programming language (http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/). 
In order to run the model, you must download and install NetLogo environment (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml)
Then click and open Chicago-IPV.nlogo. The interface should look similar to the image below. First click 'setup' in order to populate the model
with all necessary data. For each simulation, modify parameters using sliding bars as needed, then click 'go'. Since the model is based on probabilitites,
it is necessary to run at least several simulations for each combination of parameters in order to run any further analyses. 

The model must use the accompanied data. It comes in two forms: geographic (GIS) data are located in 'gis_data' directory (containing Chicago boundary files and others), and data on households, population and location of social services are located in 'data' directory.
